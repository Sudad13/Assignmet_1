## What are some differences between interfaces and types in TypeScript?

In typescript both can be used for declaring types of different data types, Here are some diffrences:

* Type can be used for primitive and non primitive data types
* While interface can only be used for object only

* Type aliases cannot be redefined within single code base
* Interface can be defined more than once in a single code base and it merges automatically

* Type cannot be implemented or extended by class
* Interface can be implemented by class, while OOP implmentation


## How does TypeScript help in improving code quality and project maintainability?

Typescript is basically javascript under the hood but it offers some bindings while coding.

While we can use a variable in different data types and js doesnt warns us but in typescript it binds a fixed datatype
to a variable, though it gives us the option same as js using "any" keyword. As a result, typescript gets fewer runtime error
from javascript related to type error. Furthermore, ts gets well documented by default.

In typescript we get the function, method or attributes suggestion that are available within that scope of variable or object. By these 
way, we can easily know the range of that method or attribute. We dont have to explicitely check the availability.

Most importantly, it is going hand in hand with javascript, the features we can use in javascript, we can avail that in typescipt too.
So, its not even backdated.

The real potential of typescript is seen in larger projects, when there is a bunch of files, larger codebase, it gets really hard to 
find those type error or other errors like this, but typescript is not prone to those errors, as a result, these errors will not occur.

So, using typescript is really important for the developers, it saves their time by not getting those dirty runtime errors.
